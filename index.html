          <h2>About</h2>

          <p>
            I am a final year PhD student at Luleå University of Technology in Sweden
            set to defend my dissertation <em>“Using computational and quantitative
            linguistic methods to inform language assessment and learning”</em> in
            December 2026.
          </p>

          <p>
            My research is centred around learner corpus linguistics, with a particular
            focus on describing written learner language in English (mostly L2 but also
            L1) in relation to different educational contexts and situations. As such,
            I analyse a variety of linguistic constructs (e.g., lexical and grammatical
            complexity, accuracy, cohesion) in, for example, high-stakes exams,
            cross-sectional/longitudinal corpora, and mixed-methods designs.
          </p>

          <p>
            I use an array of advanced statistical methods and computational tools in my
            research but am also a proponent of minimally sufficient methods to maintain
            linguistic interpretability – an explicit aim of my research is for it to be
            useful for teachers, test constructors, and curriculum designers. To
            complement my interest in learner language, I also work with research
            methodology by, for example, developing computational measures of different
            linguistic constructs and examining research methodology in the study of
            English learner language in the Swedish context.
